# Braille Music Website
## Motivation
How can technology help the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community to pursue their passion for music? This project aims to answer this question by enhancing the accessibility to music education for the BVI community in Vietnam. Despite being a large and talented group of people with disabilities worldwide, the BVI community faces numerous obstacles in their musical endeavors, such as the lack of training and knowledge among music teachers, and the scarcity of musical materials in Braille. This project remarkably demonstrates how the project is a typical example of the Digital Humanities field, as it applies technological tools to solve a social problem and meet a community need.

## Findings
To develop a tool that is accessible for both BVI individuals and their music teachers/caregivers, market research about available solutions has been conducted to further understand their advantages, limitations in helping the BVI on their learning music journey. During our research, we have found some limitations of other applications that we could improve to better accommodate the BVI and their caregivers:
1. Other applications are too complicated as there are too many features, leading to confusion and discouraging the use of the applications by BVI individuals and their teachers/mentors/caregivers.
2. They only support converting musicXML files to braille music notations, while most music scores in musicXML format are not freely available. With the softwares that offers end-to-end conversion, they are charged a high price.
3. While some applications do provide free musicXML and braille representation files, it would limit the users to only learn the music sheets already available in the archive. This restriction may hinder the exploration and learning of a broader range of music.
With those insights in mind, and with the advice of the experts and experienced, the accessibility and simplicity of the product are emphasized. With further research and inquiries from experts, the main targeted user of the application shifted from people of the BVI community to teachers/mentors of BVI communities that focus on music. This is due to the technical limitations of OMR, which require a photo of high quality and proper angle. These can be very challenging for users of the BVI community. This is also a response to music students of the BVI community which suggests that the proposed application might be more beneficial for music teachers to prepare their teaching materials and support their students if the students want to convert a music score of their preferences.

## Processing Pipeline
The website is developed using knowledge acquired from the research of related applications, including SM Music Reader, Musescore, Audiveris,... and libraries such as music21. In short the deliverable should be able to perform as follow:
1. Upload/Capture photos of the traditional physical music sheets
2. Digitalize the music sheets by using OMR techniques to recognize and interpret the music symbols
3. Convert recognized music symbols into braille music notations 
4. Generate the braille representation of the music scores in a text (.txt) file and download the file.
With the file of the braille representation of the music scores, users can use the braille embosser to print the braille music sheets to read them.

## Acknowledgement
This project could not have been successful without the enthusiastic support from 4 professors of the course “Applied Digital Humanities for Vietnam Studies”. We would like to express our sincerest thanks to the founder of the course, Professor Nguyễn Nam of Fulbright University Vietnam. With expertise in the field of East Asian Studies and especially a background in Vietnam Studies, he has brought us unique perspectives on aspects of the transformation of Vietnamese society. Moreover, we would like to express our deep gratitude to the enthusiastic support of three Professors from Hanoi National University, including Professor Lê Thị Thanh Lê. Lê Thanh Hà, Lê Công Thương with deep expertise in the field of digital humanities. Three supported us in project orientation and technology product implementation. Professor Lê Thị Thanh Lê has great comments and advice in the area of research and community exploration. Professors Lê Thanh Hà and Lê Công Thương have brought us useful knowledge in the field of engineering and technology. We would like to sincerely thank the support and companionship of four wonderful professors who are outstanding in the field of digital humanities in Vietnam.
